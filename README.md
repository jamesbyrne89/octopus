### Notes

Site is deployed at https://angry-villani-efc4e5.netlify.app/

I was limited in the time I could spend working on this test, so there are some things I would do given more time to refine the project:

- Add further test coverage
- Improve accessibility
- Refactor some of the state management (e.g. multiple reducers)
- Remove some global CSS styles and make CSS-in-JS styles more granular
- Folder structure
- Remove some 'any' types
